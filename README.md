A First-person Shooter game in the Windows Console.

# About

This is a first-person shooter that runs in the Windows Console. The game comes complete with a the ability to walk around a 3D space,
shoot at "ghost" enemies who appear on your tactical map, and get a score. You can also draw your own map and place it into the game with
ease (you will have to modify a single line of code). 


To run simply make sure your console size is set to 120x40, as that is
the only resolution that is currently supported.
